# Project 2 Doucumentation

<u>Controls:</u>

1) click mouse and drag to draw and make sound

2) release mouse or press "BACKSPACE" to erase the output of clicking the mouse.



This part of the project was based on **week 9 (Mutating data)** and **week 10 (3D space)**. The data I used to "Mutate" was audio and then turn it into something visually abstract.

I made an instrument that plays a song and manipulates 3D shapes abstractly based on the frequency of the song and an interation with the instrument with sound from
imported libraries (link down below). I wanted the sounds to be similar to the sounds you showed us in the videos from Lecture 9 specifically *"FFT Impostor"*  and *"Envelope"*. Where the audio shifts in intensity not only from the audio, but from the visuals as well. 

As you move hold your mouse and move up the screen the intensity gets higher and when you bring it back down it will lower.
